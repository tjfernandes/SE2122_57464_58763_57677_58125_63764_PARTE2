Code smells review

Lazy Class:
Concordo tanto com o code smell sugerido pelo colega como com a solução dada e penso que está tudo em conformidade com o que nos foi apresentado em aula.

Data Class:
I agree with the data class code smell in class VersionPreferences, the fact that it  only has the constructor and a getter and is such a small class means the code on this class
should be in another class.

Feature Envy:
I agree with this smell identified by my teammate. In fact, the class is more focusing in manipulating data from another class than its own data.
This smell is explained well according to what was teached in classes.
