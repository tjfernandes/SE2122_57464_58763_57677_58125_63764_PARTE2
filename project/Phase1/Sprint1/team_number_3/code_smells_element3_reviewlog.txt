Long method:
I agree with both my teammate identification of the smell and its refactoring solution. The method is in fact a long method and the best
solution that I found is to divide it into smaller and simpler methods.

Lazy Class:
I agree with my teammate code smell identification and the refactoring solution. The class is indeed a lazy class because this class has not a single method,
which means the class isn’t too useful. As this class doesn´t have a single method, it should be deleted.

Feature Envy:
I agree with my teammate code smell identification and the refactoring solution. This class has indeed the code smell called Feature Envy, because all its methods
accesses the data of the class BidEntryType more than its own data. As a payoff of moving the methods to the BidEntryTipe class, the result could be a better code
organization.
